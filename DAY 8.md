ðŸ”¢ Day 8 â€“ Introduction to NumPy

ðŸ“š Topics Covered:
- What is NumPy?  
- Creating Arrays  
- Array Data Types (`dtype`)  
- Array Shape (`shape`)  

 ðŸ§  What is NumPy?

- **NumPy** (Numerical Python) is a powerful library used for **numerical and scientific computing**.  
- It provides support for **multi-dimensional arrays** and **mathematical operations** on large datasets efficiently.  
- It is widely used in **data science, machine learning, and AI**.

 ðŸ”¹ Why NumPy?

- Faster than Python lists  
- Uses less memory  
- Supports vectorized operations (no loops needed)  
- Provides tools for statistics, linear algebra, and data transformation  


ðŸ”¹ Data Type (`dtype`)

- Every NumPy array has a data type that defines what kind of elements it holds (integers, floats, strings, etc.).  
- You can check or specify the `dtype` when creating an array.


| Common dtype | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `int` | Integer numbers |
| `float` | Decimal numbers |
| `str` | String type |
| `bool` | Boolean (True/False) |

 ðŸ”¹ Array Shape (`shape`)

- The **shape** of an array tells how many **rows and columns** it has (its dimensions).  
- It is represented as a tuple.

ðŸ”¹ Additional Useful Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| `ndim` | Number of dimensions | `arr.ndim` |
| `size` | Total number of elements | `arr.size` |
| `dtype` | Data type of array elements | `arr.dtype` |
| `shape` | Dimensions of array | `arr.shape` |
