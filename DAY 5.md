 🐍 Day 5 – Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.  
They help in reducing repetition and improving code organization.

🔹 Defining a Function
- Functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses `()`.
- The code inside the function runs only when the function is called.


🔹 Function with Arguments
- Functions can accept input values known as **arguments** or **parameters**.
- Arguments allow functions to work dynamically with different data.


🔹 Returning Values
- Functions can send data back using the `return` statement.
- The `return` keyword stops the function execution and sends a result back.


🔹 Types of Functions
| Type | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| Built-in | Predefined functions like `print()`, `len()`, `range()` |
| User-defined | Created by users using `def` keyword |
| Lambda | Short anonymous functions using `lambda` keyword |
