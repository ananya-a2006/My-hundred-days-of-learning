🐍📘 Day 9 – Indexing & Slicing 
🔹 1. Indexing

Indexing is the method of accessing individual elements in a sequence such as lists, strings, or tuples by using their position number.
Positive indexing starts from 0 and moves from the beginning of the sequence, while negative indexing starts from -1 and moves from the end.
Indexing is used to locate, inspect, or modify a single element inside a sequence.

🔹 2. Slicing

Slicing is the process of extracting a portion of a sequence.
It uses a start position, an end position, and an optional step value.
Slicing helps in selecting a continuous part of the sequence or extracting elements in a particular pattern.
It is useful for retrieving segments, creating new sequences, and performing efficient data analysis.

🔹 3. Importance of Indexing & Slicing

Indexing and slicing are powerful tools in Python because they make it easy to:

Access data

Modify data

Extract useful parts of sequences

These concepts are heavily used in data processing, string handling, list operations, and array manipulation tasks.

🔹 4. Application on Different Sequences

Indexing and slicing can be applied on:

Lists

Strings

Tuples

Nested sequences

Lists allow modification using indexing, whereas strings and tuples are immutable.
Even though immutable sequences cannot be changed, slicing can still be used to create new sequences from them.

🔹 5. Advanced Slicing

Advanced slicing uses the step value to control movement between elements.
A step value greater than 1 selects elements at intervals.
A negative step value reverses the direction of slicing.
This enables operations like reversing sequences or extracting alternating elements.
