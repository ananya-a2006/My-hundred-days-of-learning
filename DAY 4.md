🐍 Day 4 – Conditionals & Loops

opics Covered:
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- `for` Loops  
- `while` Loops  
- Loop Control Statements (`break`, `continue`)  


🧠 Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions and execute different parts of code based on certain conditions.

🔹 if Statement
- Used to test a condition.  
- The block of statements inside `if` runs **only if the condition is true**.  
- If the condition is false, the block is skipped.

🔹 else Statement
- Used with `if` to execute a block of code **when the condition is false**.  
- Ensures that one of the two blocks (`if` or `else`) always runs.

🔹 elif Statement
- Short for **"else if"**.  
- Used when there are **multiple conditions** to test.  
- If the first condition is false, Python checks the next one.  
- Only the block with a **true condition** runs.

🔹 Nested if–else
- Means **an if–else statement inside another if or else block**.  
- Used for checking **multiple levels** of conditions.  
- The inner `if` is executed only when the outer `if` condition is true.

 🔁 2. Loops in Python

Loops are used to **repeat** a block of code multiple times.

🔸 `for` Loop

Used to iterate over sequences like lists, strings, tuples, etc.

🔹 `while` Loop

Runs **as long as** the condition is True.

⏹️ 3. Loop Control Statements

| Statement | Description | Example |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| `break` | Exits the loop immediately | `if x == 5: break` |
| `continue` | Skips to the next iteration | `if x == 3: continue` |
| `pass` | Does nothing (placeholder) | `if x == 1: pass` |
